# GPT Golf

How many turns will it take you to get GPT to say the target word?
Here are the rules of the game: 
- Your goal is to get GPT to say a target word in as few turns as possible.
- Each turn, you add up to 5 words to its dialogue. 
- When you click submit, your prompt will be added to the dialogue. Then GPT will also add to the dialogue.
- You can't say the target word, but as soon as GPT does, you win!
